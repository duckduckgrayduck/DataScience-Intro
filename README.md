This repository contains source code, PDFs, and Jupyter notebooks for a Python course held in Fall 2023. 
The course primarily covered four topics:
* web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium)
* automation
* data science (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
* machine learning (supervised & unsupervised learning, neural networks)

This course iterated on a curation of unique and open source tutorials from RealPython, GeeksforGeeks, and TowardsDataScience.
